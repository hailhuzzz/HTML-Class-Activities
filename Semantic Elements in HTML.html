            <h2>Facts about cats</h2>
            <p>
                Domestic cats (Felis catus) are fascinating, highly specialized mammals that have lived alongside humans for thousands
                of years, known for their unique blend of independence and affection. Genetically, house cats share approximately 95.6%
                of their DNA with tigers and retain many of their wild ancestors' behaviors, such as stalking prey and scent marking.
                They are obligate carnivores, meaning their diet must primarily consist of animal protein, and notably, they cannot
                taste sweetness due to a genetic mutation.

                Physically, cats are built for agility. They possess a flexible spine with more vertebrae than humans, free-floating
                collarbones that allow them to squeeze through tight spaces, and retractable claws to keep them sharp for climbing and
                hunting. Their senses are incredibly acute: they have excellent night vision, can rotate their ears 180 degrees to
                pinpoint sounds, and use their sensitive whiskers to navigate their surroundings.

                Behaviorally, cats spend a significant portion of their lives sleeping, typically between 12 to 16 hours a day, to
                conserve energy. They communicate through a complex mix of over 100 vocalizations (meows, purrs, chirps, etc.), body
                language, and scent marking. Interestingly, adult cats primarily meow to communicate with humans, not other cats. A
                cat's purr, while often a sign of contentment, can also be a self-soothing mechanism when they are stressed or
                injured,
                as the vibration frequency may promote healing in muscles and bones.
